# Pong
This game is simply a recreation of the popular game Pong made in C++ and SFML. This is only compatible with windows, however, the source is available for you to manually compile using your own IDE. VS has already been fully configured the work as soon as you download. To simply download, press the green code button and download as zip. Then, extract from the zip and go into the bin folder and run Pong.exe. If the exe does not run because of a font error, simply navigate to your windows folder and confirm that a font named "arial.ttf" is in that folder. If not, simply download the arial font and put it in either the same directory as the game or in your windows fonts folder.
